# OCTâ€“Biomarker Alignment
OCTâ€“Biomarker alignment performs CLIP-style semantic alignment between RETFound and 33 biomarkers from the UK Biobank.

## Download the weights for RETFound
Please download the OCT-based weights from the RETFound repository: [RETFound_MAE](https://github.com/rmaphoh/RETFound_MAE).

## Orginize the data
Please organize the data as:
- Dataset
  - training dataset
  - test dataset
  - training.csv
  - test.csv

The CSV files should be organized as shown in the figure below.
